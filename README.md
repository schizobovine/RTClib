RTCLib
======

One of many forks to JeeLab's RTC library for handling dates and times for the
Arduino platform. This particular one based on mizraith's fork for DS3231 &
Chronodot support. Originally forked for tweaks to squeeze it onto an ATTiny85
using TinyWire, and now ESP8266 support.

Throwing the GPL2.0 on the code since that's what I do with most of mine; most
of the repos seemed to lack a license file and mizraith's says public domain
for some of his stuff, so hopefully this is alright? If not, contact me and let
me know--I'm ok with pretty much any free/open source/public domain licensing,
but do think getting it right is important.
